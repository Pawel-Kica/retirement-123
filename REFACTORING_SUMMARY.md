# Multi-Step Form Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the multi-step simulation form from a monolithic 1,600+ line component into modular, maintainable step components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Extraction

Created separate components for each step:

- **`Step0BasicInfo.tsx`** - Age and sex input (Step 0)
- **`Step1WorkHistory.tsx`** - Work history with repeatable entries (Step 1)
- **`Step2AdditionalInfo.tsx`** - Additional programs and sick leave (Step 2)
- **`Step3Review.tsx`** - Final review and submission (Step 3)

### 2. Main Page Simplification

**Before:** `app/symulacja/page.tsx` - 1,645 lines
**After:** `app/symulacja/page.tsx` - 491 lines (70% reduction!)

The main page now only handles:

- State management
- Validation logic
- Step navigation
- Data transformation

### 3. Component Features

#### Step 0: Basic Info

- Age input with visual feedback
- Sex selection (Male/Female)
- Simple validation (age 18-100)
- Warning for users over 70

#### Step 1: Work History

- Repeatable work period entries
- Each entry includes:
  - Start year (with age hint)
  - End year (with retirement age hint)
  - Monthly gross salary
  - Contract type (UOP/UOZ/B2B)
- Smart features:
  - "Min. wiek" button to set retirement year to minimum age
  - Dynamic warnings for early retirement
  - Automatic initialization with sensible defaults
  - Validation for overlapping periods
- Early retirement checkbox with contextual hints
- Info disclaimer about modifying later

#### Step 2: Additional Info

- Account balance inputs (optional)
- Subaccount balance (OFE)
- PPK and IKZE checkboxes
- Sick leave inclusion option with detailed stats

#### Step 3: Review

- Complete summary of all entered data
- Work history display with all periods
- Statistics: total work years, retirement age
- Final submission button

### 4. Benefits

‚úÖ **Maintainability:** Each step is self-contained and easy to modify
‚úÖ **AI-Friendly:** Smaller files are easier for AI to understand and edit
‚úÖ **Testability:** Each component can be tested independently
‚úÖ **Reusability:** Step components can be reused in other flows
‚úÖ **Readability:** Clear separation of concerns
‚úÖ **Performance:** Better code splitting opportunities
‚úÖ **No Linter Errors:** Clean TypeScript with proper types

### 5. File Structure

```
components/
  simulation-steps/
    index.ts              # Central export file
    Step0BasicInfo.tsx    # 100 lines
    Step1WorkHistory.tsx  # 390 lines
    Step2AdditionalInfo.tsx # 180 lines
    Step3Review.tsx       # 230 lines

app/
  symulacja/
    page.tsx              # 491 lines (main orchestrator)
```

### 6. Technical Details

- **State Management:** Work history stored as array of entries with IDs
- **Validation:** Separate validation functions for each step
- **Data Flow:** Props passed down, callbacks passed up
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with exported interfaces
- **Smart Defaults:** Auto-populate work history when age/sex entered

### 7. Completed Requirements

‚úÖ Consolidated work history into repeatable section
‚úÖ Moved work history to Step 1 (after basic info)
‚úÖ Simplified Step 0 to only age and sex
‚úÖ Smart defaults (start at 18, end at minimum retirement age)
‚úÖ "Min. wiek" button for last work period
‚úÖ Disclaimer below "add more work periods" button
‚úÖ Updated 4-step structure with proper navigation
‚úÖ Proper label for retirement year in last entry
‚úÖ Dynamic warnings/success messages for retirement age
‚úÖ Contextual early retirement checkbox hint

### 8. Next Steps (Optional)

- Add unit tests for each step component
- Add integration tests for full flow
- Consider adding "Save Draft" functionality
- Add animation transitions between steps
- Consider adding a progress bar
